    """Abstract base class for all mock classes.

    In Mockify, mocks are composed in a tree-like structure. For example, to
    mock object with a methods we compose object mock (a root) and then
    supply it with leafs (or children), each representing single mocked
    method of that object. This class provides methods and properties for
    Mockify engine to walk through such defined structure.

    If you need to declare your own mocks, make sure you implement this
    interface.

    :param name:
        Name of this mock.

        This is later used in error reports and it identifies the mock in
        Mockify's internals. The name used here must be a valid Python
        identifier (or identifiers, concatenated with a period sign) and
        should reflect what the mock is actually mocking.

    :param session:
        Instance of :class:`mockify.core.Session` to be used.

        If not given, parent's session will be used if parent is set.
        Otherwise, a new session will be created.

    :param parent:
        Instance of :class:`BaseMock` representing parent for this mock.

        When this parameter is given, mock implicitly uses paren't session
        object.

        Parameters ``session`` and ``parent`` are self-exclusive and cannot
        be used simultaneously.
