Mockify v0.1

I. About
--------

**Mockify** is a Python mocking library inspired by **GMock** C++ library from
Google. I started writing it when I noticed that ``unittest.mock`` from
standard library does not have many of functionalities GMock has. And since
GMock is fun and pretty easy to use, why not try mocking in similar way in
Python?
