A list of ideas
===============

* Remove unsatisfied_call_strategy and implement mock-level default actions
  instead. Once mock has a default action, it should not fail on unexpected
  or uninterested calls but rather invoke action specified.

* Make pytest plugin. Suggested name is `mockify_factory`. Such fixture
  would expose factory method for creating and verifying mocks and also will
  be automatically checked by pytest.

* Add pretty printing to exceptions (if mocks receive large args, like dicts
  or JSON objects, then exceptions are very hard to read)

* Add support for Python2.7

* Add CI job for testing against multiple Python versions
