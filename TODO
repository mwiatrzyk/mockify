A list of ideas
===============

Pending:
--------

* Make matchers ORable using | operator. For example::

    foo.expect_call(Type(int, float) | Value('spam'))

  The above will mean that we are expecting foo to be called with any int,
  any float or 'spam' as single argument.

* Remove unsatisfied_call_strategy and implement mock-level default actions
  instead. Once mock has a default action, it should not fail on unexpected
  or uninterested calls but rather invoke action specified.

* Make MockFactory for easier creation of mocks that share same context
  (and, probably, some common settings).

* Make pytest plugin. Suggested name is `mockify_factory`. Such fixture
  would expose factory method for creating and verifying mocks and also will
  be automatically checked by pytest.

* Add pretty printing to exceptions (if mocks receive large args, like dicts
  or JSON objects, then exceptions are very hard to read)

* Use setuptools-scm to get version from Git tag instead of hardcoding it in
  the code. Thanks to this versioning will be completely handled by Git.

Done:
-----

* Make UnexpectedCall exception and check if there are expectations for
  given mock name. Currently, even if mock name is the one we expect but
  args are different, UninterestedCall is raised, and that may be confusing.

Obsolete:
---------

* Use deployed Mockify to test the one being developed.
